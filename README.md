Hey there! Fred here ðŸ‘‹

I research generative models and their application in life science. Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=bZwJ9oUAAAAJ&hl=en).

As much as I donâ€™t want to come across as too nerdy, I love math and coding way too much to deny it.

I mostly code in Python, PyTorch, and dabble in Triton when Iâ€™m feeling kernel writing. Check out the codebases below :)

I believe science and knowledge should be open and accessible to everyone and I practice my belief with open-source.
