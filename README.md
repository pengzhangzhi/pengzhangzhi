## Hello and Welcome! 


<!--  ### I am Zhangzhi Peng (å½­å¼ æ™º).-->

- I am a problem solver, active thinker, and a big fan of SCIENCE. Programming is just one of my tools. 
- I am active in open science (open source). My goal is to remove all the barriers in the way of knowledge.
- I am a lifelong self-taught student. I learned most of my CS knowledge from online resources (courses and books), which shaped me into who I am today. See https://pengzhangzhi.github.io/self-taught/ for details. 


ðŸŽ‰**Update**:
Those words were written when I was an undergraduate. I am now a phd student and the above still holds.
