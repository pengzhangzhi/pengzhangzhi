## Hello and Welcome! 👋


### I am Zhangzhi Peng (彭张智).


#### FACTS ABOUT ME.
I am problem solver and active thinker. Seriously I am a CS student.
- skills:
    - Python (pytorch)
    - C/ C++. I have taken an online course 6.S081, where I use C to basically build a XV6 (an unix-like OS). Really appreciate abstract designs behind OS (e.g., file system, and virtual memory). 
    - Web Devlopment (front- and back-end)
        - front-end: bootstrap, layui, and of couse HTML, CSS, javascript.
        - back-end: JAVA (springboot), javascript (node.js framework: express) 
- 👯 Research intersts: Deep learning, representation learning, and self-supervised learning.
- 😄 Hobbys: 
    - System Design. System design is a huge topic that covers many areas like Software Design and operating system. I find desgining is not intellectually hard but requires philosophical wisdom. Sometimes to realize high performance you have to give up the efficiency or vice versa. The goal is to balance or compromise among various factors. My first principle is 'keep it simple & keep it stupid (K.I.S.S)' . 
    - sports: swimming, sanda (散打)... I love all kinds of sports, can not name them all. 
    - Vlog: Recording memories.
