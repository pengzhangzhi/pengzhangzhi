## Hello and Welcome! 


### I am Zhangzhi Peng (彭张智).

- I am a problem solver, active thinker and big fan of SCIENCE. Programming is just one of my tools. 
- I am active in open science (open source). My goal is to remove all the barriers in the way of knowledge.
- I am a life-long self-taught student. I learned most of my CS knowledge from online resources (courses and books), which shapes me into who I am today. See https://pengzhangzhi.github.io/self-taught/ for details.
