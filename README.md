Hey there! Fred here ðŸ‘‹

I research machine learning and its applications in life sciences. Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=bZwJ9oUAAAAJ&hl=en) (itâ€™s where all my academic flexes live).

As much as I donâ€™t want to come across as too nerdy, I love math and coding way too much to deny it.

I mostly code in Python, PyTorch, and dabble in Triton when Iâ€™m feeling kernel writing. Check out the codebases I maintained : )
